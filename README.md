### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently enrolled at Codeup, learning the Data Science program. 
Once Iâ€™m done here, I will be continued to pursue my Data Science Undergrad program at Indiana University.
I recently ended my 22 years of commitment to the United State Air Force.  Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast and love learning about Data Science.
